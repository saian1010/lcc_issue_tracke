     # Note: You'll need to use "logged in" and role checks like the ones below
     # on every single endpoint that should be restricted to logged-in users,
     # or users with a certain role. Otherwise, anyone who knows the URL can
     # access that page.
     #
     # In this example we've just repeated the code everywhere (you'll see the
     # same checks in staff.py and admin.py), but it would be a great idea to
     # extract these checks into reusable functions. You could place them in
     # user.py with the rest of the login system, for example, and import them
     # into other modules as necessary.
     #
     # One common way to implement login and role checks in Flask is with "View
     # Decorators", such as the "login_required" example in the official
     # tutorial [1]. If you choose to use that approach, you'll need to adapt
     # it a little to our project, as we don't store the username in `g.user`.
